## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. For iOS, install CocoaPods:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

npm run ios
# or
yarn ios
```

### Android

```bash
npm run android
# or
yarn android
```

## Development

## Architecture

- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **API Communication**: WebSocket-based client (compatible with Vue frontend)
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for persistent data
- **UI Components**: Custom components following React Native Reusables patterns

## Connecting to Server

When you first launch the app, you'll be prompted to enter:

- Server Address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8095`)
- Username
- Password

Your credentials will be securely stored for future sessions.

## Contributing

This mobile app shares type definitions and API patterns with the Vue frontend. When adding new features, ensure compatibility with the existing API structure.
