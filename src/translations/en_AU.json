When no measurement (yet) exists for a radio station, Music Assistant will fallback to a dynamic (but less accurate) loudness levelling filter.\n\nTIP: Radio streams often have varying loudness levels, especially during announcements and commercials.\nYou can choose to enforce dynamic volume normalisation to radio streams, even if a (average) loudness measurement for the radio station exists. \n \n**Options:**\n\n - Disabled - do not apply volume normalisation at all for radio streams. \n  - Force dynamic - Enforce dynamic volume levelling at all times. \n  - Measurement only (no fallback) - Apply (overall) volume\/gain correction based on stored measurement. If we do not have any measurement, do not apply normalisation.\n  - Fallback to gain correction - Apply (overall) volume\/gain correction based on stored measurement. If we do not have any measurement, fallback to a predefined gain correction.\n - Fixed gain correction - Always apply the fixed volume\/gain correction.\n  - Fallback to dynamic - Automatically pick the best option: Apply (overall) volume\/gain correction based on stored measurement if we have any, allow fallback to dynamic mode if no measurement is available."

When no measurement (yet) exists for a track, Music Assistant will by default fallback to a dynamic (but less accurate) loudness levelling filter. This ensures no big spikes\/falls in the volume level between tracks, even if there is no accurate measurement yet but the dynamic leveler can sometimes compress the dynamic range a bit, although that should not be audible in most cases.\n\n\n**Options:**\n\n - Disabled - do not apply volume normalisation at all for radio streams.\n - Force dynamic - Enforce dynamic volume levelling at all times. \n - Measurement only (no fallback) - Apply (overall) volume\/gain correction based on stored measurement.
